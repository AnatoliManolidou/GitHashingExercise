# GitHashingExercise

This project tkes a four-digit number as an input and generates a hash output. Specifically, i have chosen the SHA-256 hashing
algorithm.

As regards the hash_script.sh, you first have to add execute permissions and then the script can be invoked like this: 
```bash
./hash_script.sh "your 4-digit number"
```
since the input is taken from the user via the keyboard. Also, "your 4-digit number" can be any number or the last four digits of your AEM.
